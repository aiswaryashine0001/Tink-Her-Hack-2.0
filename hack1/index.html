                <h2>What is Human Trafficking?</h2>
                <p>Human trafficking is a form of modern-day slavery involving the exploitation of individuals through force, fraud, or coercion for purposes such as forced labor, sexual exploitation, or commercial sexual exploitation. It deprives victims of their freedom and dignity, often involving the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring, or receipt of persons through the use of threat, force, fraud, or deception.</p>
